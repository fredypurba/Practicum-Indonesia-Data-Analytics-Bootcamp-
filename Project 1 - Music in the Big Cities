In this project, you will compare musical preferences in the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. You will study the actual Y.Music data to test the hypotheses below and compare user behavior in these two cities.

1.1 Purpose:
Testing three hypotheses:

User activity varies depending on the day and city.
On Monday mornings, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville tune in to different genres. This also applies to Friday nights.
Listeners in Springfield and Shelbyville have different preferences. In Springfield, they prefer pop music, while Shelbyville, rap music has more fans.

1.2 Stages
Data about user behavior is stored in the /datasets/music_project_en.csv file. There is no information about the quality of the data, so you need to check it before testing the hypothesis.

First, you will evaluate the quality of the data and see if the problem is significant. Then, during data pre-processing, you will try to account for the most serious problems.

The project will consist of three phases:

Data Overview
Data Pre-processing
Testing Hypotheses
